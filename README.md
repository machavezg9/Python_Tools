# Python_Tools

### rename_files.py
Old project, don't remember the purpose, I think it was written to delete certain text from .ROM files

### sep_pdf.py
Recipe (Note: Windows only)
1. Create new folder on desktop named Separate Me
2. Save python script anywhere
3. Make sure you have "pdfrw" package installed, if not, pip install pdfrw
4. Place all PDF files that you want split, into the "Separate Me" folder
5. Run Script

(Note: added 10 second delay per file to not bog down system, you can change that as you like)
